-- 4. The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). 
-- Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict 
-- the output to these two routes.
SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2

-- 5. Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, 
-- without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.

-- 6. The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer 
-- to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown.

-- 9. Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, 
-- including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.

-- 10. Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend. Show the bus no. and company 
-- for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer, and the bus no. and company for the second bus.
SELECT a.num, a.company, stopb.name, d.num, d.company

-- Quiz 2. Select the code that shows the stops that are on route.num '2A' which can be reached with one bus from Haymarket?
SELECT S2.id, S2.name, R2.company, R2.num
  FROM stops S1, stops S2, route R1, route R2
